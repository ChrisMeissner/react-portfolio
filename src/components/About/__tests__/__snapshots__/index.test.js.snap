        Born and raised in El Dorado Hills, California (but I tell people I am from Sacramento). I recieved my undergraduate degree from UCLA with a major in Theater and a specialization in Musical Theater. I have been so lucky to have performed in some really great projects (West Side Story: in Concert with the San Fransico Symphony (Baby John), DTLA's production of Carrie (Ensemble), Grease: Live! (Ensemble), and Frozen! (Olaf) to name a few). When I'm not singing or dancing, I like to stay creative with photography, video production, and graphic design. I am taking the Coding Bootcamp through UCLA because, one day, I would like to own my own business and be able to do everything in house, including full stack web development. I hope you enjoy my work! Let's connect!
